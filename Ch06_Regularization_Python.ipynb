This is puzzling if you think carefully about it, given that LS is BLUE. Also, there is not even a tuning parameter. The only thing that seems to matter is $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\parallel \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}\\parallel^2}$.  The proof is not hard; you can find it at the bottom.

Now imagine a circle around the origin where the diameter is defined by a tuning parameter $t$ such that it satisfies $\\parallel \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\parallel^2 <t$.  Our solution can only be inside this circle.  Without any constraint on $t$, i.e. $t=\\infty$ we will get $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$ as an estimate that minimizes $\\parallel \\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X}\\beta \\parallel^2$. But as t gets smaller, we depart from our $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$ since the solution has to be within the circle.  Thus, we can see that the solution we want is on the circle closest to $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$, which is the point circle that touches the ellipse.  Equivalently, our solution can be thought of as shrinkage.  As t gets smaller, we are shrinking our $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$  toward zero on the diagonal line from $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$ to the origin.\n",

    "Unlike $L_2$ norm, $L_1$ norm has corners and edges that touch the contour of $\\parallel \\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\parallel^2$ first most of the time.  This acts as the variable selector in high-dimensional space.  Thus, when we look at the solution path of LASSO, we see some coefficients take on the value of zero.\n",

And this goes on until all $t$ is so big that the diamond shaped region includes $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$, in which case, all the estimates of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ becomes $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$.  Or conversely, if you decrease your $t$, to zero your estimated  $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ starts to get shrunk toward zero from $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$.  So you can see that we are doing shrinkage estimation. Then, we want to choose $t$ to get the sparsest model with the lowest cross-validation error.\n",
