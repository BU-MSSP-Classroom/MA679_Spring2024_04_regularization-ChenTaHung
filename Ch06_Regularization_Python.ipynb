The only thing that seems to matter is $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\parallel \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}\\parallel^2}$.  The proof is not hard; you can find it at the bottom.

    "As $t$ increases, we gradually see more and more $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$s coming into our model.  And this goes on until all $t$ is so big that the diamond shaped region includes $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$, in which case, all the estimates of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ becomes $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$.  Or conversely, if you decrease your $t$, to zero your estimated  $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ starts to get shrunk toward zero from $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{LS}$.  So you can see that we are doing shrinkage estimation. Then, we want to choose $t$ to get the sparsest model with the lowest cross-validation error.\n",
